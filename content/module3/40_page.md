Let's check how Jenkins is configured to call the Torque API. The Jenkins Sandbox you deployed earlier preloaded the Torque plugin that provides pre-defined functions (Groovy code) that you can call when defining a new script. 

__Note__: If you have an existing Jenkins instance, you would install and configure the Jenkins plugin for Torque from the Torque __Integrations__ page and follow these [instructions](https://colonysupport.quali.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001035668).
 
1\. Click the "demo" link to the pre-loaded pipeline script.

2\. Click __Configure__.

3\. Navigate to the __Pipeline__ tab. Note that the "Use Groovy Sandbox" box is checked.

4\. Scroll down the script until you reach the "Integration Tests" stage. You use the __startSandbox()__ method to run sandbox from a blueprint passing all needed parameters.

5\. Then, once the sandbox is ready, you use the __getEndpoint()__ function to take application endpoint, which could be used to perform some tests (not covered by this job).

6\. At the end you, terminate the sandbox with the __endSandbox()__ method, and move on to the next stage.
