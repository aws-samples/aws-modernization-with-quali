In the next few steps, you will create and configure a new "space" in Torque. A space is a way to provide a specific team with access to the resources they need. It is part of the proper governance practices a company like Gourmet Inc wants to enforce. In our scenario, we are creating a space for the Platform Ops team to deploy and manage tools like Jenkins.

1.Go to the Administration area.
