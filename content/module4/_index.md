# Module 4

### Gourmet Inc wants to be more efficient with the use of cloud infrastructure. There is a new AWS service, DocumentDB, that can save cost and improve your backend application resilience. 

You are the DevOps engineer and would like to use this service instead of MongoDB for your promotion application.

Torque supports Terraform modules natively. That allows you to rapidely take advantage of the latest AWS cloud services that are released on a regular basis.

* You will make a simple change to your blueprint to include a predefined Terraform module located in the terraform folder of your blueprint repository
