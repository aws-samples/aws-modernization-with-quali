You've realized that you need more time to work on your promotion manager application functionality testing and your sandbox is about to expire! Thankfully with Torque, this will not be a problem. You can easily extend the duration for another hour if your user policy allows you. 
 
Before the sandbox expires, extend the default time from 2 hrs to 3 hrs.

By default, it will be automatically deprovisioned once the specified time has expired.
