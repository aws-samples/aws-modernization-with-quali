You've realized that you need more time to work on your Promotion Manager application's functionality testing, and your sandbox is about to expire! Thankfully with Torque, this will not be a problem. You can easily extend the duration for another hour if your user policy allows you. 
 
Before the sandbox expires, extend the sandbox time by 3 hours.

By default, it will be automatically deprovisioned once the specified time has expired, but if you're done and don't need the environment anymore, you can easily end it sooner.
