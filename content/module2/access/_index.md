Once you have launched your sandbox, you can now access your environment directly from Torque and start testing your application:

1\. Open the sandbox and check its deployment status.

2\. When the sandbox status is __Active__, access the web front end of the promotion manager application. You can do this directly from the sandbox by clicking the sandbox's __Summary__ tab and then selecting the application's quick link.

3\. Check application functionality and run load testing.
