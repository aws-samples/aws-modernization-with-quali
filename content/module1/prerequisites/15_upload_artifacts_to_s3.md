1\. Download the source artifacts from https://github.com/QualiTorque/aws-workshop-torque/tree/master/artifacts.  
If you use Safari as a browser you may have problems downloading the file in tar.gz format, in this case try to download the same file with Google Chrome or any other browser.

2\. Create the folder structure in your AWS S3 bucket.

* Create the _artifacts_ folder.
