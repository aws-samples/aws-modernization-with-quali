#### Your first task is to provide developers a self-service blueprint that has the entire promotion application deployed on a single VM (instead of the default three VMs), so they can do their unit testing and save infra cost.

Open the blueprint named promotions-manager-all-aws-dev from the Blueprints catalog.
Inside the blueprint view, you can see the 3 different components we need for this application:
