* You are a DevOps engineer at Gourmet Inc and you just learned that the DevOps engineer responsible for launching the company's new shopping cart app left the company. Additionally, you found out that this person left you zero documentation and apparently hasn’t configured anything that can be reused for the deployment. You know that if you had time you would stand up a Jenkins server, set up dev/test/prod, get a pipeline going, enable testing, etc. — but you don’t have time.

* You heard from a DevOps colleague that Quali can help you get everything you need in a fraction of the time it would normally take, so you decide to take Quali for a test spin and see how it stacks up.

* Gourmet Inc management also wants your approach to be applicable to other applications within the company in the future, as well as be compliant with PCI for credit card payment.
