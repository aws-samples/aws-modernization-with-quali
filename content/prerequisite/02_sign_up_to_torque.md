After signing up, you'll be greated with some samples to better understand how sandboxes in Torque behave, so choose one, and review the sandbox creation process. When done come back here and we'll continue this workshop. Later we'll explain again in more detail about sandboxes and we'll create real ones as part of this workshop.
